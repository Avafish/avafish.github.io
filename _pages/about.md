Welcome to Zewen Long's Personal Homepage!

I am a master student at [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/) (expected to graduate in June 2025). Additionally, I am a member at [Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC)](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/en/EN/volumn/home.shtml), National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Shu Wu](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~shuwu?language=en).

My research interests lie in the field of Recommender Systems, with a focus on sequential recommendation. Currently, I am highly intrigued by exploring the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Trustworthy AI.

Playing Language Game with LLMs Leads to Jailbreaking

Yu Peng<sup>\*</sup>, **Zewen Long<sup>\*</sup>**, Fangming Dong, Congyi Li, Shu Wu, Kai Chen

**Submission to The 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025).**

We discover a novel jailbreak attack method to exploit large language models (LLMs) by playing custom-designed language games. This method circumvents LLM safety alignments, showcasing the vulnerability of current safety protocols.

GOT4Rec: Graph of Thoughts for Sequential Recommendation

**Zewen Long**, Liang Wang, Shu Wu, Qiang Liu, Liang Wang

**Submission to The 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025).**

We propose the GOT4Rec model, which first utilizes the graph of thoughts (GoT) prompting strategy in the sequential recommendation domain to capture three key types of information contained within user history sequences: short-term interests, long-term interests and collaborative information from other users.

[Personalized Interest Sustainability Modeling for Sequential POI Recommendation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3583780.3615278)

**Zewen Long<sup>\*</sup>**, Liang Wang<sup>\*</sup>, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu

**Accepted by The 32nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2023).**

We propose a personalized interest sustainability model for sequential POI recommendation (INSPIRE) to capture whether each user's interest in specific POIs will sustain beyond the training time, aiding in more accurate and sustainable recommendations.
